                    Living our best lives is a daily practice. Too often as teachers, we forget to take care of our
                    basic needs: stretching, breathing, staying hydrated, and eating well. If
                    you’ve ever thought: “there’s not enough time in the day” - we can relate. The good news is,
                    nurturing a healthy body doesn’t take much time after all. Research shows that infusing short
                    intervals of exercise into your routine can reduce stress, increase energy, and lead to better
                    sleep. Regular movement, hydration, nutritious food, and sleep are essential to help us feel our
                    best. We’ve collected a variety of tools to help boost your mood, strengthen your
                    body, and make eating healthy easier.</p>
