                    ever
                    that teachers and educators prioritize their mental health. Scholarly research indicates that
                    mindfulness practices have&nbsp;a positive impact on the brain, specifically in areas that impact
                    focus and emotional regulation. In this section, we’ve compiled a variety of online resources that
                    have been shown to reduce stress, decrease anxiety, and bring a greater sense of peace with their
                    practice. Take some time to select the Mind tools that will help you care for one of the most
                    important components of your person: your Mind.</p>
